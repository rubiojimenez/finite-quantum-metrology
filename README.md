# Finite-sample quantum metrology

Collection of scripts implementing a finite-sample approach to quantum metrology, as developed in:

J. Rubio Jim√©nez, *Non-asymptotic quantum metrology: extracting maximum information from limited data*, PhD thesis, University of Sussex (2020). Available at [arXiv:1912.02324](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02324).

While these scripts were originally developed for the examples presented in the thesis, they may be adapted to a wide range of modern quantum metrology problems.
